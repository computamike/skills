## Welcome to Skills Project.

### What is the Skills Project?
My wife - Rachel - was looking at potentially applying for a new job - and had noticed that a lot of the job adverts were asking for the same skills (mostly around windows / email / excel).  So I wrote a training course for her.  Training Course is a bit of a stretch.  I just wanted an excuse to have a play with [exelearning](https://exelearning.net/en/) - I had this idea : Could I develope a SCORM compatable course with some relevant content and host it in GitHub pages?  

The main problem is that Rachel has used excel and windows and all of these skills and tools - but purely in relation to her employer.  She knows what to do to update an excel spreadsheet (for instance), but if an employer were to ask her to grab the excel file from the network and update it - that might be more challenging.  Imagine if there's a spreadsheet, and she needs to build a pie chart based on the figures and then print it to the colour printer - but that she might not have the colour printer installed on her machine - how could she solve this problem.

Add into this companies can have different sizes and networking architectures - it becomes impossible to write something concrete  - Do this and this will solve your problems.


### Ok so what topics is this going to cover?
Well the biggie is Networking.  There are principles that can be helpful in a network environment (regardless of the architecture).  Things like resetting passwords, file encryption etc.  Then I plan to add extra modules to cover other areas to consider.

Currently the Module list is : 

* Networks 
* Email
* Word
* Excel

In addition I have some cheatsheets that should help (hopefully).
